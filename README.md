# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Introduction

This is  a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

 [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library is used here to work with date and time.

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
